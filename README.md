# What is Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs is a rich mobility dataset collected from multiple sensors (incl. GPS, GSM, WiFi, Bluetooth) on the smartphones of 81 individuals. 
In addition to sensor data, Breadcrumbs also contains ground-truth data regarding people points of interest (incl. semantic labels) as well as 
demographic attributes, contact records, calendar events, lifestyle information, and social relationship labels between the participants of the 
study. This data collection campaign was launched in the spring of 2018.

## What exactly does the dataset contain?
- GPS coordinates: Latitude, Longitude, Altitude and Timestamp
- Bluetooth: Scanned device UUID's and Timestamp
- Wi-Fi: Scanned SSID's and Timestamp
- Smartphone notification events
- User demographics (30 different attributes)
- Point of Interests of all participants with the description
- Participant relationships
